## A summary

**Bait.** Beneath the veneer of the "wellness" theme, counsellors and some psychologists are actually referral agents for the real business of abnormal psychology and "suicide prevention". It is not very obvious as these centres have put tremendous effort to shake off their traditional reputation of being associated with the stigma of "mental" issues. Over the years, the UCCs hve gone through major rebranding and outright masking of their true nature through various well designed "mental health" campaigns and converted themselves into a form of self-motivational centres. An excellent case study is MWKLSWC, which has gone a step further and created networks of mental health advocates (i.e. SMU Peer Helpers) that tout support, encouragement and self-development. These centres promote "mental wellness" concepts such as "mindfulness" to normalise, and therefore destigmatise, the going for counselling services. Whether or not students actually need counselling, the UCCs have become a sort of free talk therapy service actively marketed to students. All the universities, however, do mandate compulsory referral of struggling students to the UCCs, especially in the case of poor academic performance.

**Hook.** In reality, the field of psychology has been hijacked by pharmaceutical companies to prop up the mental health pharmaceutical supply chain. Research for psychology is readily financed by deep-pocketed pharmaceutical corporations as they are the referral agents to psychiatrists and doctors. For all three universities, this referral policy to psychiatrists and general practitioners is quite literally written in policy. Whether or not the doctor is out-sourced or internal differs between the big three autonomous universities in Singapore.

**Reel.** Abnormal psychology, or psychiatry, is a medical field that emerged from the mental asylum keepers of yore. It was with the discovery of anti-psychotic chlorpromazine in 1952, that sparked a medical revolution for the treatment of the insane. Finally, it seemed, there was hope for the mentally ill, and quickly, a series of new medical compounds were invented. 

These compounds can be broadly broken into four categories:

1. Anti-psychotics: for the treatment of psychosis, such as schizophrenia and delusional disorders, the group that were traditionally referred to as the "insane".

2. Anti-depressants: for the treatment of depression, typically associated with suicide cases and the lows of maniac bipolar disorder

3. Anxiolytics or anti-anxiety agents: for the treatment of anxiety "disorders", such as panic disorder

4. Mood-stabilisers: for the treatment of bipolar disorders, of which some of the notable agents are also anti-psychotics

The medicalisation of the care of the mentally ill in 1952 sparked a renaissance of sorts as the chaotic state of abnormal psychology and psychoanalyses prior to that period demanded a new form of taxonomic classification. It was that year that the American Psychiatric Association (APA), developed the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which has been the bible for the global mental health industry ever since. The unfortunate truth, that still holds till today, is that the DSM played and still plays no regard for the etiology of mental illnesses[^^I1]. Even to the present date, psychiatrists have produce no quantitative evidence before dishing out a diagnosis, unlike other medical professions. The perverse incentive for psychiatry, then, is to diagnose as much and as often as possible, with the unabashed support of the profiteering pharmaceutical industry. Psychiatric diagnoses have now become highly commercially influenced, with the number of diseases rising from 128 in DSM-I (1952) to 541 in DSM-V (2013). Correspondingly, the revenue of the APA Inc. has risen from US$1.27 million (1968) to US$135.23 million (2013)[^^I2]^,^[^^I3].

But worse, these drugs cause dependence and addiction. Once dependence sets in, the patient or victim, whether actually mentally ill or correctly diagnosed, experiences psychiatric drug withdrawal, which involves severe illness, both physical and mental. The psychiatric profession, unsurprisingly, has been mulish in the recognition, both in research and clinic setting, to recognise these effects. The result is an astounding cycle of iatrogenesis and **POLYDRUGGING**, sometimes under forced treatment, often resulting in **SUICIDE**.

## Areas of brilliance

Putting aside whether or not this business strategy helps people, which is indeed a difficult and controversial subject, the commercial success of the "mental health" industry has been nothing short of brilliance; A cash cow for psychologists, counsellors, psychiatrists and Big Pharma alike.

**Bait - hurdle #1: advertising restrictions.** The usual constraints of the medical profession often involves the forbidding of individual doctors in advertising by law & code, notwithstanding American laws that actually do allow doctors and pharmaceutical companies to perform direct to consumer marketing[^^I4]. Psychiatry has the dubious distinction of having a massive ready sales force in the form of counsellors and psychologists that are often encouraged to refer clients for psychiatric assessment, whether or not they are fully aware of the system. As a matter of fact, this symbiosis between counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists creates a mutually reinforcing synergy of authority and credibility. Where the cruel practices of psychiatrist is dark and insidious, the store front of the system at the counsellor's and psychologist's office is decked with encouraging messages and floral incense. The icing in the cake is the entrenchment of the referral system into school policy and into the legislative system, which will be elaborated upon on a later occasion. Seen as a commercial operation, a crucial part of the business is to build positive brand equity, which involves proliferating and entrenching **key marketing messages** in the name of "suicide prevention" and "wellness" that deliberately omit the reality of involuntary admission, forced treatment and drug dependency hiding behind the effulgent veneer.

**Hook - hurdle #2: professionals acting in good faith that realise the harm.** In all areas of the profession, there is a genuine Saviour Complex that they are "saving lives" from the horrors of suicide and mental trauma. This is no coincidence. Counsellors and psychologists are not taught about psychopharmacology at an extensive level, for which the psychiatrists, as medical professionals, are suppose to be well-versed in. Moreover, there is a pervasive mentality that the act of doctors accrues no liability to the para-mental health profession. Education is indoctrination, and by deliberately influencing research, Big Pharma is has successfully crowded out negative research from textbooks. In rare cases, psychologists and counsellors do become aware that they are harming people, but by then they would have accumulated so many referrals that disturbing the wasps' nest would be an act of folly. A similar incentive of vested interests plagues the psychiatric profession, where their livelihoods depend on maintaining the charade.

**Reel - hurdle #3 litigation from victims.** Lastly, where drug injury does happen, and victims decide to resort to litigation, the aforementioned charade comes into play. That charade comes in the form of research, which as mentioned, is based on diagnoses and measurement that are fungible and given by the very same people that benefit from positive research and write the research, creating an inextricable knot of conflict of interest that pharmaceutical companies have exploited and even manipulated through ghost-writing. With "research" and "statistics" of the DSM, psychiatrists are able to transfer their liability to pharmaceutical companies who purport the benefits of their drugs. Para-mental health professionals, of course, cite that they do not have the training and that they are the prescribers. Pharmaceutical companies then point to the psychiatrists and their research as evidence for the safety and efficacy of their drugs, often remunerating them handsomely to testify in court. Pharmaceutical companies are notoriously difficult to litigate, given their deep pockets and army of lawyers. An attempt to take the makers of benzodiazepines to court in a class action lawsuit failed in 1994 when funding ran dry[^^I5]. Not many victims or their family members sue against psychiatrists, if at all. Family members may believe these doctors and patients themselves are trapped in a state of "Intoxication Anosognosia"[^^I6], as prominent critic of psychiatry and psychiatrist Peter Breggin, M.D calls it. A game of finger pointing and denial makes untangling this web of financial interests intractable, and the lone maligned patient often defeated. The last ingredient is probably the most lethal of all - stigma - which is deeply entrenched in society and hiring practices that do not distinguish between correct or incorrect diagnoses. Sociolegal consequences of letting family know could be disastrous if there are familial tensions. A psychiatric label could be exploited by spouse to gain custody of the children and sibling or child to gain control over the inheritance. With that many implications, most victims stay silent.

## Wellness porn: the key marketing messages

It is mentioned that the system works on key marketing messages earlier on, that we shall call, somewhat perjoratively, "wellness porn", for the concealment of information while using the "wellness" term.

A business depends on key marketing messages that it distributes to its target audience. The unique thing about healthcare is its immediate appeal across all segments of society. This key marketing messages are contained within two types of marketing activities.

**Research.** Research can be prescriptive and descriptive, positive or negative. Prescripive research in psychology and counselling commonly espouse the positives of early intervention and therapy, thereby bolstering the "bait" portion of the marketing strategy. Psychiatric research is often negative descriptive, portraying an "epidemic" of suicide and mental illness, as is usual with most medical professions and expected if coming from a pharmaceutical company, and positive precriptive, espousing the need for medication. Research is a form of marketing but mainly catered to rest of the medical profession, other academics and the government, from which they obtain grants and policy support. The hidden part is that the "disorder" is very much determined by the same community that writes the paper and hence is marked with a huge positive bias in psychiatric diagnosis both due to financial incentives, but also psychological phenomenon and individual circumstance such as confirmatory bias, trigger happy doctors too eager to diagnose and the practice of defensive medicine to push the blame of a death to a patient's "disorder"; the latter, of course, being proven by the Rosenhan Experiment and crucial to the survival of the profession. The research is what props up these key marketing messages as distortions in research are quickly transferred into the public, as demonstrated by the Singapore Mental Health Study for which is the basis of the Beyond The Label campaign.

**Campaigns.** By winning over the counselling and psychological profession, which are largely not bound legally by the same advertisement restrictions, and the government, which clearly has the spending power, the system is able to summon a broad range of marketing campaigns.

What are some of the key messages that Big Pharma and the mental health professions want the populace to believe?

{title: "Figure 2: Wellness Porn", align: "left", width: 100%, optional: attribute_list}
| Message                     | Official reason        | Likely agenda                                                        |
|=============================|:======================:|:=====================================================================:|
| | |
| **"Seek early treatment** | Suicide prevention | Convinces normal people facing situational issues into consuming these products that are addictive and cause disorders of the mind. |
| | |
| **"Seek help if you are stressed** | Suicide prevention, empathy | Anxiety pills are the most addictive and are the most seductively angled. Stress happens to be frequently blamed for all sort of disorders. |
| | |
| **"It’s for your wellness**| Counselling, therapy and medication, if needed, are there to help you through tough times, empathy | Positive marketing angle designed to invite consumers into the offices of mental health professionals. Also establishes Bona Fide intent of the perpetrators in the eyes of law. |
| | |
| **"Mental illness is like diabetes"** | Destigmatisation and medication compliance | Convinces both normal and disordered patients, once “diagnosed” to comply with medication for the benefit of Big Pharma. |

# Bait: How do UCCs invite to treat?

{caption: "Figure 3: Campaign examples", alt: "Campaign examples", align: middle, width: 100%, id: "fig3"}
![Figure 3: Campaign examples](images/3.Campaigns.jpg)

The phenomenon of marketing is by no means a unique phenomenon to Singapore or to the universities in Singapore as seen in Figure 3](#fig3); It is a global trend spearheaded by the WHO's mental health teams staffed almost entirely of psychiatrists. There are a few flavours that global mental health campaigns come in and the list below is most certainly not exhaustive:

* **Mental health awareness:** A rather iffy term, the message is by far the least well defined but generally paints the idea that mental illness is common and establishes suicide as being rooted in a mental illness, while painting mental health campaigns in a positive light. Some subsidiary campaigns that buttress into these awareness campaigns included "Mindfulness", a psychological technique to pay attention to the now without judgement in an effort to reduce rumination, improve attentional control, emotional regulation and self-awareness, thereby, purportedly, enhancing physical health[^^I7]. An example of this is WHO's World Mental Health Day and the Mental Health Awareness Singapore campaign by SAMH, a psychiatry-affiliated advocacy non-profit organisation.

* **Suicide prevention:** Having established mental illness as the root of psychological distress and suicide, the idea then is that psychiatry, though sometimes not explicitly mentioned, prevents suicide and that "early treatment" should be an order. Together with this concept is the blaming of the media for inspiring copycat suicide under research about the "Werther Effect", coined by David Phillips in 1974, for which we discuss in detail later.

* **Destigmatisation:** The history of psychiatry has traditionally associated with the insane, criminal and generally societally mal-adjusted. It also has been associated with suicide in the universities, of course we now know that it is likely associated with the drugs, even if spontaneous suicide do exist. The aim is to normalise "seeking help" by reducing the stigma, inadvertently boosting the business of the ecosystem of the mental health fraternity.

* **Wellness:** The connection between counselling and psychiatry is very much hidden, but there has been a transfer of techniques from the counselling profession to psychiatry in the usage of "wellness". The counselling profession, in that sense, markets psychiatry on behalf of psychiatrists and doctors by preaching Mindfulness and Peer Helping in schools. An example of this is MWKLSWC's peer helping programme.

### Case study: Mrs Wong Kwok Leong Student Wellness Centre (MWKLSWC)

Let us look into the function of MWKLSWC of SMU[^^I9]. Counselling, still remains very much a brick & mortar trade.

* **Operations.** Its operations at the basement of SMU's Li Ka Shing Library consists of two compounds. Firstly, *The Counselling Place*, a multi-chambered room where counsellors ply their trade of talk therapy and drug referral. And secondly, *The Cosy Haven*, a very plush student lounge and headquarters of the SMU Peer Helpers, the student mental health advocacy group, deck with comfortable counches, massage chairs and bean bags.

* **Key opinion leaders.** Within the school, the SMU Peer Helpers, a student run and led, but counsellor supervised, student organisation acts as a powerful student influence network and community of opinion leaders that carry out the student initiated mental health advocacy activities for free. A force for good in general as research has found that their workshops have enhanced student's personal development on many fronts[^^I9].

* **Marketing.** The centre is also the force behind the regular Mindfulness talks and conferences, and various marketing campaigns engaged both digitally, through social media, web and internal mail, and physically, through posters, standees and other marketing collateral.

In all of these cases, the association with psychiatry is not mentioned, as in fact, Professor Chong Siow Ann, the most influential psychiatrist in Singapore, is advisor to the centre, and the counsellors regularly refer students for psychiatriac evaluation and/or psychiatric prescription from the adjacent GP. The system draws in students and turn them into defenders of "mental health", and by extension, the drugs, while creating an enormous and ignorant ready market unaware of the true nature of the products that are really being sold.

## SMU: Mrs Wong Kwok Leong Student Centre

{caption: "Figure 4: Mrs Wong Kwok Leong Student Wellness Centre", alt: "Mrs Wong Kwok Leong Student Wellness Centre", align: middle, width: 100%}
![Figure 4: Mrs Wong Kwok Leong Student Wellness Centre](images/4.MWKLSWC.jpg)

SMU, mooted by Dr Tony Tan (now President of Singapore), was founded in 2000 as Singapore's first American-style university broadly modelled after the Wharton School - University of Pennsylvania as conceived by Professor Tan Chin Tiong. It is currently located in the middle of the city, along the historic Fort Canning Hill that became the talk of the British Empire during the 1942 Battle of Singapore. Although new in many ways, its internal policies and academics were largely grandfathered from NUS and NTU. As such, the system is vaguely similar in all three universities.

{caption: "Figure 5: MWKLSWC's governance structure", alt: "MWKLSWC's governance structure", align: middle, width: 100%}
![Figure 5: MWKLSWC's governance structure](images/5.MWKLSWC.jpg)

MWKLSWC lies under the purview of the Office of Dean of Students, which at the point of the writing of this publication is occupied by ex-NMP (Nominated Member of Parliament) and prominent sociologist Professor Paulin Tay Straughan, and direct supervisor of Dr Ada Chung Yee Lin, the head of the centre who oversees four other counsellors in the centre. It is named after a wealthy donor Mrs Wong Kwok Leong for her contribution of S$1.6 million to the school's endownment fund.

The wellness centre has an advisory board, of which is known to be occupied by two members:

* **Professor Chong Siow Ann:** prominent psychiatrist in Singapore and Vice-Chairman of Research at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Singapore's only psychiatric hospital and asylum. He is also the leading researcher within psychiatry in Singapore, having hundreds of research papers to his name.

* **Dr Frederick Low:** accomplished counsellor and vice-president of the Singapore Association for Counselling, currently working at the Children's Aid Society.

Enshrined in school policy is doctor referral programme, where the website states[^^I10]:

>
> *"External mental health agencies may be recommended for longer-term follow-up and treatment. All referrals are made with students' explicit agrement."*
> - *SMU website*
>
> *"The Centre may also refer client to the General Practitioner (medical attention) on campus in cases which require medical attention"* 
> - *Oasis, the internal student platform*
>

The adjacent private GP clinic *The Clinic @ Campus* is the GP referred in the school policy, currently staffed by Dr Mervin Lim Lok Houw. It is also known that there is a list of psychiatrists written into school policy for which a number of students have been referred to for anti-depressants and benzodiazepines to be issued, of which three can be directly traces to Dr Ada Chung. As such, it is apparent that Prof Chong's involvement with MWKLSWC has more than just meets the eye.

## NUS: Unversity Counselling Service & Clinical & Health Psychology Centre

{caption: "Figure 6: University Counselling Service & Clinical & Health Psychology Centre", alt: "University Counselling Service, align: middle, width: 100%}
![Figure 6: University Counselling Service & Clinical & Health Psychology Centre](images/6.UCS.jpg)

NUS has its roots even before the founding of Singapore and has a shared origin with the current University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur through the original King Edward VII Medical School. It has a sprawling campus across much of Clementi and Bukit Timah. Mental health services are administered from the University Health Centre (UHC) at 20 Lower Kent Ridge Road. Tucked away on the second floor of the building after walking up a discreet stairwell is a lounge and a corridor of many closed-doored counselling rooms, the compounds of NUS's UCS. At the ground floor of the UHC is the clinic, consisting of over 10 doctors, all of which are employees of NUS, serving the large student population. At the basement is the Clinical and Health Psychology Centre (CHPC) run by the NUS Department of Psychology[^^I11] that provides professional psychology help and assessment before allowing psychiatric intervention. There are approximately 2 or 3 psychiatrists at any one point of which one is Dr Clarice Hong Pei Hsia as of academic year 2018/19 term 1, according to ground research. Yale-NUS has its own Wellness Centre that is in some way affiliated to UCS. Also at the basement of UHC is the aptly named Wellness Office administering the system.

{caption: "Figure 7: UCS's governance structure", alt: "UCS's governance structure", align: middle, width: 100%}
![Figure 7: UCS's governance structure](images/7.UCS.jpg)

UCS is held within the purview of the NUS adminstration, specifically under Professor Florence Ling Yean Yng's, Vice Provost (Student Life) and faculty member of NUS Department of Building, School of Design and Environment (SDE), portfolio. Directly managing UHC is the director of UHC and medicl doctor, Dr Patrick Tan. Counselling services at Yale-NUS is headed up by Mr Goh Zhengqin, of which there is a team of around 10 counsellors. CHPC's acting director, as of the writing of this publication is Associate Professor Iliana Magiati.

All the three centres and the Wellness Centre of Yale-NUS cross-refer to each other to some extent and to the psychiatric services provided by the in-house psychiatrists. As stated on their website:

>
> *"Psychiatric consultations are only made through referrals from a counselor at UCS or a medical doctor at the University Health Service (Clinic)."*
> - *NUS website*
>

Should it be deemed necessary, students may be involuntarily pressured into NUH psychiatric Ward 33. NUH, National University Hospital, is the affiliated hospital to NUS's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM). It is recorded that some NUS students have been forced into the ward against their will after hitting the keywords "sad" or "depressed", but it is unknown to what extent this has been abused by counsellors in order to get students off their hands. It is also unknown whether UHC has an advisory board, much like what is set up in SMU and NTU.

It is also reported that it is part of the school policy and the purview of the Dean of Student Life of each faculty to interview and then refer students to UCS in the event of a drastic drop in GPA or failure on the pretext of "concerned(sic) for... well-being".

## NTU: University Wellbeing Centre

Located on the Jurong West region of Singapore, NTU was originally a Chinese University called Nanyang University. After a complicated merger and demerger with NUS, it was named NTU in 1991 and grew into a full fledged university, albeit with a strong focus on engineering. It also has its own Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCSoM) added in 2017.

{caption: "Figure 8: University Wellbeing Centre", alt: "University Wellbeing Centre, align: middle, width: 100%}
![Figure 8: University Wellbeing Centre](images/8.UWC.jpg)

UWC is located within the University Health Services (UHS) building at 36 Nanyang Avenue on the second floor of the right and left wings - the right leading to the student counselling centre and the left leading to the student counselling centre. NTU is the only school that offers staff counselling. On the ground floor is the medical clinic that is in-sourced to private clinic operator Fullerton Healthcare, that is the operations are outsource but the clinic functions as though it is part of the school with students having to pay no medical fees, except for dental. Up the stairwell leading to UWC are various encouraging messages, after which you will be brought into a glass sliding door emblazoned with the words "University Wellbeing Centre (For Students)". The counselling rooms are hidden inside the building and well guarded by counter staff.

{caption: "Figure 9: UWC's governance structure", alt: "UWC's governance structure", align: middle, width: 100%}
![Figure 9: UWC's governance structure](images/9.UWC.jpg)

Affairs related to UHS is under Associate Provost (Student Life) Professor Anthony Kwok Kian-Woon, another prominent sociologist. The UHS itself is managed by medical doctor Dr Goh Chin Foo, with the title of Chief Health, Safety & Emergency Officer; And UWC, by Mariam Hamid, the head counsellor.

Similar to SMU, Prof Chong is the advisor to UHS holding the title of "Health Specialist Panel" along with Prof Kwok. This is no coincidence. Prof Kwok and Prof Chong have worked together on multiple pro-psychiatry research papers including the latest Singapore Mental Health Study 2016 funded through a grant from the Temasek Holdings financed Singapore Millennium Foundation Research Grant Programme.

## Outside of schools into our social services

Perhaps a common thread you might be getting is that it is unusual that sociology and psychiatry is consorting in such a manner.

Sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858-1917), widely viewed as the father of sociology and the emperical approach it employs, published Le suicide: Étude de sociologie [Suicide: A Study in Sociology] in 1897 to tackle to subject of suicide, challenging the monopoly of psychology, and hence also psychiatry, over the topic. Since mental distress and suicide can either be defined as a problem of society or a problem of psychology, a natural rivalry exists between the two fields.

Where sociology has lost out to psychiatry in is the backing of a powerful industry backing. Sociology has gained general acceptance across many fields, spreading its efforts quite thin, where psychology has focused almost its entire efforts defining suicide as a mental issue and psychiatry as a medical one, with products to sell.

This reflects no less in the way that social services in Singapore, and the world, is conducted. In Singapore, social servies fall under the purview of the Ministry of Social and Family Services (MSF) through the umbrella body the National Council of Social Services (NCSS) that coordinates over 450 social service entities. The mark of psychiatry permaeates throughout the social service sector, as seen 

{caption: "Figure 10: Psychiatry in Singapore's social services", alt: "Psychiatry in Singapore's social services", align: middle, width: 100%, id: "fig10"}
![Figure 10: Psychiatry in Singapore's social services](images/10.SocialServices.jpg)

Prof Chong is the pre-eminent intellectual authority in the mental health system as the only psychiatrist sitting on mental health policy formulation committees on both on national and tertiary education levels. He shares this position with Prof Kwok, whom unsurprising, is more than eager to agree with the narrative that social services and mental health are inextricably linked. Prof Chong is also chief examiner for the psychiatry residency programme and one of the examiners for the Singapore Association for Counselling.

[Figure 10](#fig10) also outlines the key institutions that uphold the mental health industry in Singapore. The premier instutition for mental health advocacy is SAMH, which has existed since 1968, and is mainly driven by the psychiatric community to drive the "mental health awareness" angle. The other organisation is the Silver Ribbon Commission, founded by three staff of IMH in 2005, and also the Singapore chapter of Ms Jean Singleton Liechty J.D.'s Silver Ribbon Coalition. The Silver Ribbon organisation takes the "destigmatisation" angle.

Another notable organisation is the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), a suicide hotline that grew into its current "suicide prevention" agenda, with some notable association with psychiatrists, though with a good mix of psychological and suicidological affiliations. It issues the media guidelines from which is based off WHO's recommendations.

Certainly, what we see is that the close relationship between academic psychiatry and academic sociology has translated into the practical nuts and bolts of applied psychiatry and social service policy. The implications to both national public policy and school policy has been tremendous. A systematic concealment of psychiatry is seen from head to toe by redirecting the public's attention to Wellness Porn messages, often justified under "not scaring" or preventing people from "seeking help".

The DSM-5 breaks them down into 22 categories (20 if excluding the "Other mental disorders" and "Other conditions that may be a focus category"), while ICD-10 has 11 categories as expounded in below, of which the last category is labelled "Mental disorder, not otherwise specified, as such makes [10 effective categories](#fig11), which are broadly ordered in level of severity in the pyramid, defined as amount of disruption to living.

Regardless of how many disorders there are, there stands only four main categories of drugs for which psychiatry deems can resolve all these purported disorders through the rebalancing of a "chemical imbalance", an unproven concept[^^I13] that even if true, is not used in the clinical diagnosis as apparent in the DSM and in practice. The history of psychopharmacology, however, has never been to understand etiology before finding a pharmacological agent, but to work backwards; That is, most of the drugs were noted to have some form of psychoactive property when applied to other type of diseases, and then were imported into the field of psychiatry for these happenstance effects.

Modern pharmaceutical entrepeneurship and profiteering has taken that to the next level, to find new uses of these substances for other reasons, such as sedation, and even relabelling the same substance for another purported condition. An example is Wellbutrin (bupruprion), which is the exact same chemical, but rebranded into Zyban, a aid for smoking cessation. Another approach is to modify the same substance in small ways and rebrand it as a new and improved drug, which we see in the case of benzodiazepines, of which we will talk about in greater detail. Rebranding and profiteering is not necessarily a bad thing, but where the opportunity arises, pharmaceutical companies push the boundaries of what is beneficial for the patient, putting profit over the wellbeing of its customers. No where has this been taken to such extremes, as it has been in psychiatry, because of unfetter power to diagnose without the need for physical examination to identify pathology and etiology of the disease before making a prescription.

The reasons for this is simple, we do not fully understand the brain, perhaps the most complex computation machine that, many believe, derives from the quantum world. Intelligence can be modelled by neural networks, but these if-then-that models can never replace the infinite creativity, serendipity and emotional capacity of the human mind. Mental illnesses, then, were considered incurable.

The historically most important drug classes are the mood-stabilisers and then the anti-psychotics. It was in *Psychiatrie (6th edition 1899)* where Emile Kraepelin first sorted the mentally into two categories[^^I14]: dementia praecox and manic-depressive illness, which were to evolve into the nomenclature of psychotic and bipolar disorders we now know in the DSM. It is in these two categories of the classically mentally ill that advances in psychopharmacology were to take over the medical field. 

## Mood-stablisers

Lithium was originally used for gout, a result of excess uric acid in the body, in the 19th century as recommended by English physician Garrod. It was first used for Acute Mania in the form of lithium bromide in the 1870s by William Hammond, former US Surgeon General, due to the theory of "uric acid diathesis" that excess uric acid was responsible for a range of illnesses[^^I15]. 

However, it was John Cade, a 37-year-old medical officer working in a war veterans' repatriation hospital for chronic psychiatric illness in an outer suburb of Melbourne, Australia, at the time of this discovery, or rather, rediscovery of lithium that sparked the psychopharmacological revolution. The son a psychiatrist, Cade had just been released from three years' imprisonment in the infamous Changi POW camp in Singapore during the Japanese Occupation, where he had "ample time to meditate on the possible causes of functional psychoses" and theorised that a metabolite had to do with the mental symptoms his fellow prisoners were exhibiting[^^I15a], when he undertook research on the same "uric acid diathesis" theory and chanced upon lithium carbonate's effects in animal studies. His trial on humans found a dramatic effect on 3 patients with melancholia, but no benefit to patients with schizophrenia. The substance was finally approved in 1970 by the FDA for the treatment of mania, and the carbonate variant continues to be used to this day[^^I16].

Other substances that soon followed Lithium, with a fairly comprehensive list below:

* Lithium Carbonate (Lithium)

* Sodium Valproate or Valproic Acid (Depakote)

* Lamotigrine (Lamictal)

* Carbamazepine (Tegretol) [non-FDA approved]

* Topiramate (Topamax)

* Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal)

* **Some anti-psychotics:** chlorpromazine (Thorazine), haloperidol (Haldol), risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), quetiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprazole (Abilify), and asenapine (Saphris)

Till now, Lithium remains the main, almost first line, mania specific drug, with valproate, lamotrigine and carbamazepine, also commonly prescribed, being anticonvulsants and others being anti-psychotics. The actual mechanism of how this substance, which we use in our batteries, has this effect, is still unknown.

## Anti-psychotics

It was psychotic disorders (aka dementia praecox), that were always viewed as traditional insanity, and were treated with various quack therapies from trepanning to bloodletting since antiquity, that the major revolution was sparked. In Western society, the mentally ill were either housed by the Catholic clergy in madhouses encouraged to repent their sins and to seek refuge in God's mercy, or in asylums where they were experimented upon with barbaric treatments[^^I18] of which would emergy frontal lobotomy, insulin shock and electroshock therapy.

The psychopharmacological approach to the treatment of the psychotically ill started in the phenothiazine class of drugs, a group of chemicals anti-histaminic properties that includes promathazine (aka cough syrup), with the serendipitous discovery of chloropromazine by Henri-Marie Laborit, whom was much about the therapeutic use of the substance in sleep disorders to limited success.

Phenothiazines, themselves, emerged from the precursor chemical Methylene blue, a blue dye that was recorded in 1899 to have been used by Genoan doctor Pietro Bodoni to calm psychotic people in the Italian asylums. Phenothiazines were inspired by the Methylene blue and produced by French pharma company Rhône-Poulenc (now part of Aventis)[^I18a].

Chloropromazine was first tried on a manaic patient in 1952 in a study by Joseph Hammon to much success, although together with barbiturates and opiates, and as such was not taken seriously. It was only when Jean Delay and Deniker conducted a study in the same year with chlorpromazine alone that they found it effective and confirmed it with further studies, coining the term "neuroleptic".

An explosion of other neuroleptics soon followed with haloperidol, a butyrophenone, in 1958 by Paul Janssen, and more phenothiazines trifluperazine, thioridazine and fluphenazine; then clozapine, modified from imipramine, a type of tricyclic anti-depressant, and so on.

Anti-psychotics can be broadly broken into two generations, the second generation referring to later developed substance found in the search for treatment with fewer side effects, with notable drugs recommended by MOH guidlines and mentioned in the IMH psychiatry textbook noted[^^I19]:

* First generation (typical):

  - *Phenothiazines:* chlorpromazine (Thorazine), trifluoperazine (Stelazine)
  
  - *Butyrophenones*
  
  - *Thioxanthenes*
  
  - *Diphenylbutylpiperidines*
  
  - *Benzamides:* sulpiride (Dogmatil)
  
  - *Tricyclics*

* First generation (typical):

  - *Benzamides:* amisulpride (Solian)
  
  - *Benzisoxazoles/benzisothiazoles:* resperidone (Risperdal), paliperidone (Invega), ziprasidone (Geodon)
  
  - *Butyrophenones*
  
  - *Phenylpiperazines/quinolinones:* aripripazole (Abilify)
  
  - *Tricyclics:* clozapine (Clozaril), olanzapine (Zyprexa), quetiapine (Seroquel)
  
Anti-psychotics were a revolution in the area of mental health, but their usage has been marred by controversy, such as the forced usage of the substance on detained children at the USA-Mexico border in 2018. They also cause horrific extrapyramidal symptoms including involuntary movements akathisia & tardive dyskinesia and secondary parkinsonism, all of which are iatrogenic in nature. These can cause suicide, but a risk worth taking if volition is lost and the antidote benzhexol (Artane) or benztropine (Cogentin) are effective.

Once again, it is a happenstance effect that brought the drug into the field, this time from a blue dye and the cough syrup we take all so often for cough and cold.

## Anti-depressants

Again, it was the entrepreneurial chemists that chanced upon the anti-depressant class of drug, which grew out of a group of tuberculosis drugs called isoniazids, first discovered by chemists at Hoffmann-La Roche. It was after Fox and Gibas (1953) synthesized iproniazid in the search for new forms of anti-tuberculosis agents that studies began to show that the drug induced an arousal and almost euphoric state in patients[^^I20]. Thus, one of the first few anti-depressants was born, only predated by the use of amphetamines, under the name Benzedrine in 1935 by the Smith, Kline and French company[^^I21], that would come to be used in World War II as an energy booster. Amphetamines would spark a global addiction crisis in crystal meth, become a controlled substance, and then undergo chemical evolution into Ritalin and Adderall, making a resurgence in the 1960s with the work of American child psychiatrist Charles Bradley on ADHD & Benzedrine to target our children[^^I22].

### Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) and the Monoamine Hypothesis

It was around the 1960s that work surround reserpine, a treatment for hypertensive vascular diseases in the 1950s that had an unusual side effect of causing depression in patients and also found to inhibit the vesicular monoamine (i.e. serotonin and catecholamines) transporter, that the idea that patients with depression had depleted levels of serotonin, norepinphrine and dopamine was formulated. However, recent research suggests that this hypothesis needs to be revised[^^I23].

It is with this hypothesis that iproniazid (Marsilid) would become the first MOAI anti-depressant, a class which worked by causing more of the monoamine neurotransmitter concentrations to increase in the presynaptic terminal.

### Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) & Selective Norepinphrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)

Buttressing into the Monoamine Hypothesis, it was found that using SSRIs would improve the mood of patients. SSRIs themselves emerged from a postmortem study that found depleted levels of serotonin in depressive suicides. Eli Lily was quick to capitalise on this conclusion by developing SSRI inhibitors, thereby increasing serotonin concentrations in the presynaptic cleft. The first SSRI fluoxetine was invented in 1974 and market as Prozac, the now famous "happy pill", in 1988. A similar renaissance would take place with the other monoamine neurotransmitter, norepinphrine, with the release of Venlafaxine (Effexor) to the market in 1993[^^I24].

### Tricyclic Anti-depressants (TCAs)

As the success of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) sparked an intense hunt for more of these chemicals, another modification of promethazine yielded imipramine in 1951, originally also an anti-histamine, and found to have no anti-psychotic properties, but did improve the suffering of patients with severe depression. It was approved under the name Tofranil in 1959 by the FDA.

### Atypical Anti-depressants

Other anti-depressants would follow on with different mechanisms, some examples here. Bupruprion (Wellbutrin) would be approved by the FDA in 1989 and was an different drug class (aminoketone) that would work through dopamine and norepinphrine (NDRA). Mirtazepine (Remeron), a tetracyclic (TeCA & NaSSA), would join the fray in 1996. Today, we are seeing a reexploration into the use of ketamine in modulating the glutamate monoamine neurotransmitter mechanism. 

A brief summary of the classes of drugs and popular variants available in Singapore is summarised below:

* **MAOIs:** moclobemide (Aurorix)

* **SSRIs/SNRIs:** paroxetine (Paxil, SSRI), flouxetine (Prozac, SSRI), escitalopram (Lexapro, SSRI), fluvoxamine (Luvox, SSRI), sertraline (Zoloft, SSRI), citalopram (Celexa, SSRI), duloxetine (Cymbalta, SNRI), venlafaxine (Effexor, SNRI), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, SNRI)

* **TCAs:** imipramine (Tofranil), amitriptyline (Endep), clomipramine (Anafranil)

* **Atypicals:** trazodone (Desyrel, SARI), bupruprion (Wellbutrin, NDRA), agomelatine (Valdoxan), mirtazepine (NaSSA)

The history of anti-depressants is built on very shaky ground indeed, given that the monoamine hypothesis has been criticised as being over simplistic and ignores the withdrawal effect on cessation, which may worsen the situation. Nonetheless, anti-depressants have been less harmful compared to the next set of drugs, the anti-anxiety drugs.

## Anti-anxiety: Benzodiazepines & Z-drugs

The benzodiazepines were precede by the barbiturates, which were themselves predated by a group of substances that included the akaloids(e.g. opium and morphine), bromides and chloral hydrates. These substances were originally used for their sedative and/or hypnotic properties for all sorts of reasons from insomnia, surgery to calming down excitable maniac patients[^^I26].

![Figure 13: Advertisements for Barbiturates](images/13.BarbAds.jpg)

**Note:** Extracted from López-Muñoz, F., Ucha-Udabe, R., & Alamo, C. (2005). (a) Elixir Veronal from Dr Bustamante’s Laboratories it is a “Practical treatment of insomnia”. They have also added audaciously “Secure and harmless”. Finally they say that “it tastes good and acts smoothly, being absorbed by the organism”. (b) Advertisement for Abbott sodium pentobarbital in an American medical journal of 1933, highlighting its “short but powerful hypnotic effect and prolonged sedative action from small dosage”.

First synthesised in 1864 by Adolf von Baeyer (founder of Bayer), barbiturates' clinical introduction began in 1904 by German pharmaceutical companies F Bayer & Co (still Bayer in the present date) and E Merck (still Merck in the present date) when barbital (Veronal) was brought into the market. The substance was a sellout and was followed by many other compounds. However, it was phenobarbital (Veronal) employed in 1912, that was to gain widespread medical use use for its prolonged pharmacological action, utility in anaesthesia, epilepsy and seizures. Its usage in psychiatry, was quickly applied to psychotic patients, likely for the obvious utility in suppressing disruptive behaviour, whom would be induced into a constant state of stupor or better known as "sleep cures". By the 1930s to 1940s, it was in widespread use, in the same position as benzodiazepines are today as a common sleep aid audaciously marketed as "secure and harmless" that "tastes good and acts smoothly" ([figure 13](#fig13). Unsurprisingly, they proved to be not, and it was known as early as a year after Veronal's commecialisation that they caused the phenomenon of dependence, where cessation would lead to a host of unbearable symptoms and could lead to seizures, users trapped in a cycle of dose escalation and death by overdose from respiratory depression. It also induced the alarming effect of "automatism phenomenon", whereby the patient would take the dose, forget he/she took the dose and take it over and over again. It would ironically claim the lives of Fischer and von Mering, the two scientists that introduced the substance, and Marilyn Monroe on 28th August 1962[^^I27]. They were eventually supplanted by the benzodiazepines, albeit with a short interlude by (meprobamate) Mephenesin, touted as a safer alternative that did not depress breathing, but would continue to haunt society to the present day as the drug of choice for execution, euthanasia and assisted suicide.

The first benzodiazepine, chlorodiazepoxide (Librium) was discovered in 1955, as the psychopharmacological revolution in psychiatry was in ascent, by Hoffmann-La Roche chemist Leo Sternbach in a further study of work on dyes he had synthesised in the 1930s, inspired by the story of chlorpromazine. He found a compound he had modified to have similar properties to anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) meprobamate[^^I29], which would be launched as Librium in 1960. He would then go on to modify chlorodiazepoxide to create diazepam (Valium, discovered in 1961, commercialised in 1963) that would go on to sell 2.3 billion tablets and earn the nickname "Mother's Little Helper". They were marketed as suicide proof, and indeed that angle was demonstrated in rather public ways. Ronald Reagan's national security advisor, Robert McFarlane survived his suicide attempt with Valium in the middle of the Iran-Control scandal, much embarrassed when he regained consciousness[^^I30].

Benzodiazepines became the next money-train in the pharmaceutical industry. Competitors of Roche quickly jumped in with oxazepam (Serax, trialed in 1961, commercialised in 1965) Wyeth developed in 1961, then alprazolam (Xanax, patent filed in 1969, FDA approved in 1981) by Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) and trizolam (Halcion, patented in 1970, FDA approved in 1982). Many would follow, and Xanax would gain fame as a common street drug for the Xan Bars concoction frequently abused by Hollywood musicians for the sense of calm and euphoria that it could induce[^^I31].
