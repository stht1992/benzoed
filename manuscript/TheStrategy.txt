## A summary

**Bait.** Beneath the veneer of the "wellness" theme, counsellors and some psychologists are actually referral agents for the real business of abnormal psychology and "suicide prevention". It is not very obvious as these centres have put tremendous effort to shake off their traditional reputation of being associated with the stigma of "mental" issues. Over the years, the UCCs hve gone through major rebranding and outright masking of their true nature through various well designed "mental health" campaigns and converted themselves into a form of self-motivational centres. An excellent case study is MWKLSWC, which has gone a step further and created networks of mental health advocates (i.e. SMU Peer Helpers) that tout support, encouragement and self-development. These centres promote "mental wellness" concepts such as "mindfulness" to normalise, and therefore destigmatise, the going for counselling services. Whether or not students actually need counselling, the UCCs have become a sort of free talk therapy service actively marketed to students. All the universities, however, do mandate compulsory referral of struggling students to the UCCs, especially in the case of poor academic performance.

**Hook.** In reality, the field of psychology has been hijacked by pharmaceutical companies to prop up the mental health pharmaceutical supply chain. Research for psychology is readily financed by deep-pocketed pharmaceutical corporations as they are the referral agents to psychiatrists and doctors. For all three universities, this referral policy to psychiatrists and general practitioners is quite literally written in policy. Whether or not the doctor is out-sourced or internal differs between the big three autonomous universities in Singapore.

**Reel.** Abnormal psychology, or psychiatry, is a medical field that emerged from the mental asylum keepers of yore. It was with the discovery of anti-psychotic chlorpromazine in 1952, that sparked a medical revolution for the treatment of the insane. Finally, it seemed, there was hope for the mentally ill, and quickly, a series of new medical compounds were invented. 

These compounds can be broadly broken into four categories:

1. Anti-psychotics: for the treatment of psychosis, such as schizophrenia and delusional disorders, the group that were traditionally referred to as the "insane".

2. Anti-depressants: for the treatment of depression, typically associated with suicide cases and the lows of maniac bipolar disorder

3. Anxiolytics or anti-anxiety agents: for the treatment of anxiety "disorders", such as panic disorder

4. Mood-stabilisers: for the treatment of bipolar disorders, of which some of the notable agents are also anti-psychotics

The medicalisation of the care of the mentally ill in 1952 sparked a renaissance of sorts as the chaotic state of abnormal psychology and psychoanalyses prior to that period demanded a new form of taxonomic classification. It was that year that the American Psychiatric Association (APA), developed the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which has been the bible for the global mental health industry ever since. The unfortunate truth, that still holds till today, is that the DSM played and still plays no regard for the etiology of mental illnesses[^^I1]. Even to the present date, psychiatrists have produce no quantitative evidence before dishing out a diagnosis, unlike other medical professions. The perverse incentive for psychiatry, then, is to diagnose as much and as often as possible, with the unabashed support of the profiteering pharmaceutical industry. Psychiatric diagnoses have now become highly commercially influenced, with the number of diseases rising from 128 in DSM-I (1952) to 541 in DSM-V (2013). Correspondingly, the revenue of the APA Inc. has risen from US$1.27 million (1968) to US$135.23 million (2013)[^^I2]^,^[^^I3].

But worse, these drugs cause dependence and addiction. Once dependence sets in, the patient or victim, whether actually mentally ill or correctly diagnosed, experiences psychiatric drug withdrawal, which involves severe illness, both physical and mental. The psychiatric profession, unsurprisingly, has been mulish in the recognition, both in research and clinic setting, to recognise these effects. The result is an astounding cycle of iatrogenesis and **POLYDRUGGING**, sometimes under forced treatment, often resulting in **SUICIDE**.

## Areas of brilliance

Putting aside whether or not this business strategy helps people, which is indeed a difficult and controversial subject, the commercial success of the "mental health" industry has been nothing short of brilliance; A cash cow for psychologists, counsellors, psychiatrists and Big Pharma alike.

**Bait - hurdle #1: advertising restrictions.** The usual constraints of the medical profession often involves the forbidding of individual doctors in advertising by law & code, notwithstanding American laws that actually do allow doctors and pharmaceutical companies to perform direct to consumer marketing[^^I4]. Psychiatry has the dubious distinction of having a massive ready sales force in the form of counsellors and psychologists that are often encouraged to refer clients for psychiatric assessment, whether or not they are fully aware of the system. As a matter of fact, this symbiosis between counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists creates a mutually reinforcing synergy of authority and credibility. Where the cruel practices of psychiatrist is dark and insidious, the store front of the system at the counsellor's and psychologist's office is decked with encouraging messages and floral incense. The icing in the cake is the entrenchment of the referral system into school policy and into the legislative system, which will be elaborated upon on a later occasion. Seen as a commercial operation, a crucial part of the business is to build positive brand equity, which involves proliferating and entrenching **key marketing messages** in the name of "suicide prevention" and "wellness" that deliberately omit the reality of involuntary admission, forced treatment and drug dependency hiding behind the effulgent veneer.

**Hook - hurdle #2: professionals acting in good faith that realise the harm.** In all areas of the profession, there is a genuine Saviour Complex that they are "saving lives" from the horrors of suicide and mental trauma. This is no coincidence. Counsellors and psychologists are not taught about psychopharmacology at an extensive level, for which the psychiatrists, as medical professionals, are suppose to be well-versed in. Moreover, there is a pervasive mentality that the act of doctors accrues no liability to the para-mental health profession. Education is indoctrination, and by deliberately influencing research, Big Pharma is has successfully crowded out negative research from textbooks. In rare cases, psychologists and counsellors do become aware that they are harming people, but by then they would have accumulated so many referrals that disturbing the wasps' nest would be an act of folly. A similar incentive of vested interests plagues the psychiatric profession, where their livelihoods depend on maintaining the charade.

**Reel - hurdle #3 litigation from victims.** Lastly, where drug injury does happen, and victims decide to resort to litigation, the aforementioned charade comes into play. That charade comes in the form of research, which as mentioned, is based on diagnoses and measurement that are fungible and given by the very same people that benefit from positive research and write the research, creating an inextricable knot of conflict of interest that pharmaceutical companies have exploited and even manipulated through ghost-writing. With "research" and "statistics" of the DSM, psychiatrists are able to transfer their liability to pharmaceutical companies who purport the benefits of their drugs. Para-mental health professionals, of course, cite that they do not have the training and that they are the prescribers. Pharmaceutical companies then point to the psychiatrists and their research as evidence for the safety and efficacy of their drugs, often remunerating them handsomely to testify in court. Pharmaceutical companies are notoriously difficult to litigate, given their deep pockets and army of lawyers. An attempt to take the makers of benzodiazepines to court in a class action lawsuit failed in 1994 when funding ran dry[^^I5]. Not many victims or their family members sue against psychiatrists, if at all. Family members may believe these doctors and patients themselves are trapped in a state of "Intoxication Anosognosia"[^^I6], as prominent critic of psychiatry and psychiatrist Peter Breggin, M.D calls it. A game of finger pointing and denial makes untangling this web of financial interests intractable, and the lone maligned patient often defeated. The last ingredient is probably the most lethal of all - stigma - which is deeply entrenched in society and hiring practices that do not distinguish between correct or incorrect diagnoses. Sociolegal consequences of letting family know could be disastrous if there are familial tensions. A psychiatric label could be exploited by spouse to gain custody of the children and sibling or child to gain control over the inheritance. With that many implications, most victims stay silent.

## Wellness porn: the key marketing messages

It is mentioned that the system works on key marketing messages earlier on, that we shall call, somewhat perjoratively, "wellness porn", for the concealment of information while using the "wellness" term.

A business depends on key marketing messages that it distributes to its target audience. The unique thing about healthcare is its immediate appeal across all segments of society. This key marketing messages are contained within two types of marketing activities.

**Research.** Research can be prescriptive and descriptive, positive or negative. Prescripive research in psychology and counselling commonly espouse the positives of early intervention and therapy, thereby bolstering the "bait" portion of the marketing strategy. Psychiatric research is often negative descriptive, portraying an "epidemic" of suicide and mental illness, as is usual with most medical professions and expected if coming from a pharmaceutical company, and positive precriptive, espousing the need for medication. Research is a form of marketing but mainly catered to rest of the medical profession, other academics and the government, from which they obtain grants and policy support. The hidden part is that the "disorder" is very much determined by the same community that writes the paper and hence is marked with a huge positive bias in psychiatric diagnosis both due to financial incentives, but also psychological phenomenon and individual circumstance such as confirmatory bias, trigger happy doctors too eager to diagnose and the practice of defensive medicine to push the blame of a death to a patient's "disorder"; the latter, of course, being proven by the Rosenhan Experiment and crucial to the survival of the profession. The research is what props up these key marketing messages as distortions in research are quickly transferred into the public, as demonstrated by the Singapore Mental Health Study for which is the basis of the Beyond The Label campaign.

**Campaigns.** By winning over the counselling and psychological profession, which are largely not bound legally by the same advertisement restrictions, and the government, which clearly has the spending power, the system is able to summon a broad range of marketing campaigns.

What are some of the key messages that Big Pharma and the mental health professions want the populace to believe?

{title="Figure 2: Wellness Porn",width="100%"}
| Message                     | Official reason        | Likely agenda                                                        |
|=============================|:======================:|:=====================================================================:|
| | |
| **"Seek early treatment** | Suicide prevention | Convinces normal people facing situational issues into consuming these products that are addictive and cause disorders of the mind. |
| | |
| **"Seek help if you are stressed** | Suicide prevention, empathy | Anxiety pills are the most addictive and are the most seductively angled. Stress happens to be frequently blamed for all sort of disorders. |
| | |
| **"It’s for your wellness**| Counselling, therapy and medication, if needed, are there to help you through tough times, empathy | Positive marketing angle designed to invite consumers into the offices of mental health professionals. Also establishes Bona Fide intent of the perpetrators in the eyes of law. |
| | |
| **"Mental illness is like diabetes"** | Destigmatisation and medication compliance | Convinces both normal and disordered patients, once “diagnosed” to comply with medication for the benefit of Big Pharma. |

# Bait: How do UCCs invite to treat?

{title="Figure 3: Campaign examples",id="fig3"}
![Figure 3: Campaign examples](images/3.Campaigns.jpg)

The phenomenon of marketing is by no means a unique phenomenon to Singapore or to the universities in Singapore as seen in Figure 3](#fig3); It is a global trend spearheaded by the WHO's mental health teams staffed almost entirely of psychiatrists. There are a few flavours that global mental health campaigns come in and the list below is most certainly not exhaustive:

* **Mental health awareness:** A rather iffy term, the message is by far the least well defined but generally paints the idea that mental illness is common and establishes suicide as being rooted in a mental illness, while painting mental health campaigns in a positive light. Some subsidiary campaigns that buttress into these awareness campaigns included "Mindfulness", a psychological technique to pay attention to the now without judgement in an effort to reduce rumination, improve attentional control, emotional regulation and self-awareness, thereby, purportedly, enhancing physical health[^I7]. An example of this is WHO's World Mental Health Day and the Mental Health Awareness Singapore campaign by SAMH, a psychiatry-affiliated advocacy non-profit organisation.

* **Suicide prevention:** Having established mental illness as the root of psychological distress and suicide, the idea then is that psychiatry, though sometimes not explicitly mentioned, prevents suicide and that "early treatment" should be an order. Together with this concept is the blaming of the media for inspiring copycat suicide under research about the "Werther Effect", coined by David Phillips in 1974, for which we discuss in detail later.

* **Destigmatisation:** The history of psychiatry has traditionally associated with the insane, criminal and generally societally mal-adjusted. It also has been associated with suicide in the universities, of course we now know that it is likely associated with the drugs, even if spontaneous suicide do exist. The aim is to normalise "seeking help" by reducing the stigma, inadvertently boosting the business of the ecosystem of the mental health fraternity.

* **Wellness:** The connection between counselling and psychiatry is very much hidden, but there has been a transfer of techniques from the counselling profession to psychiatry in the usage of "wellness". The counselling profession, in that sense, markets psychiatry on behalf of psychiatrists and doctors by preaching Mindfulness and Peer Helping in schools. An example of this is MWKLSWC's peer helping programme.

### Case study: Mrs Wong Kwok Leong Student Wellness Centre (MWKLSWC)

Let us look into the function of MWKLSWC of SMU[^I9]. Counselling, still remains very much a brick & mortar trade.

* **Operations.** Its operations at the basement of SMU's Li Ka Shing Library consists of two compounds. Firstly, *The Counselling Place*, a multi-chambered room where counsellors ply their trade of talk therapy and drug referral. And secondly, *The Cosy Haven*, a very plush student lounge and headquarters of the SMU Peer Helpers, the student mental health advocacy group, deck with comfortable counches, massage chairs and bean bags.

* **Key opinion leaders.** Within the school, the SMU Peer Helpers, a student run and led, but counsellor supervised, student organisation acts as a powerful student influence network and community of opinion leaders that carry out the student initiated mental health advocacy activities for free. A force for good in general as research has found that their workshops have enhanced student's personal development on many fronts[^I9].

* **Marketing.** The centre is also the force behind the regular Mindfulness talks and conferences, and various marketing campaigns engaged both digitally, through social media, web and internal mail, and physically, through posters, standees and other marketing collateral.

In all of these cases, the association with psychiatry is not mentioned, as in fact, Professor Chong Siow Ann, the most influential psychiatrist in Singapore, is advisor to the centre, and the counsellors regularly refer students for psychiatriac evaluation and/or psychiatric prescription from the adjacent GP. The system draws in students and turn them into defenders of "mental health", and by extension, the drugs, while creating an enormous and ignorant ready market unaware of the true nature of the products that are really being sold.

## SMU: Mrs Wong Kwok Leong Student Centre

{title="Figure 4"}
![Figure 4: MWKLSWC](images/4.MWKLSWC.jpg)

SMU, mooted by Dr Tony Tan (now President of Singapore), was founded in 2000 as Singapore's first American-style university broadly modelled after the Wharton School - University of Pennsylvania as conceived by Professor Tan Chin Tiong. It is currently located in the middle of the city, along the historic Fort Canning Hill that became the talk of the British Empire during the 1942 Battle of Singapore. Although new in many ways, its internal policies and academics were largely grandfathered from NUS and NTU. As such, the system is vaguely similar in all three universities.

{title="Figure 5"}
![Figure 5: MWKLSWC's governance structure](images/5.MWKLSWC.jpg)

MWKLSWC lies under the purview of the Office of Dean of Students, which at the point of the writing of this publication is occupied by ex-NMP (Nominated Member of Parliament) and prominent sociologist Professor Paulin Tay Straughan, and direct supervisor of Dr Ada Chung Yee Lin, the head of the centre who oversees four other counsellors in the centre. It is named after a wealthy donor Mrs Wong Kwok Leong for her contribution of S$1.6 million to the school's endownment fund.

The wellness centre has an advisory board, of which is known to be occupied by two members:

* **Professor Chong Siow Ann:** prominent psychiatrist in Singapore and Vice-Chairman of Research at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Singapore's only psychiatric hospital and asylum. He is also the leading researcher within psychiatry in Singapore, having hundreds of research papers to his name.

* **Dr Frederick Low:** accomplished counsellor and vice-president of the Singapore Association for Counselling, currently working at the Children's Aid Society.

Enshrined in school policy is doctor referral programme, where the website states[^I10]:

>
> *"External mental health agencies may be recommended for longer-term follow-up and treatment. All referrals are made with students' explicit agrement."*
> - *SMU website*
>
> *"The Centre may also refer client to the General Practitioner (medical attention) on campus in cases which require medical attention"* 
> - *Oasis, the internal student platform*
>

The adjacent private GP clinic *The Clinic @ Campus* is the GP referred in the school policy, currently staffed by Dr Mervin Lim Lok Houw. It is also known that there is a list of psychiatrists written into school policy for which a number of students have been referred to for anti-depressants and benzodiazepines to be issued, of which three can be directly traces to Dr Ada Chung. As such, it is apparent that Prof Chong's involvement with MWKLSWC has more than just meets the eye.

## NUS: Unversity Counselling Service & Clinical & Health Psychology Centre

{title="Figure 6: UCS"}
![Figure 6: UCS](images/6.UCS.jpg)

NUS has its roots even before the founding of Singapore and has a shared origins with the current University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur through the original King Edward VII Medical School. It has a sprawling campus across much of Clementi and Bukit Timah. Mental health services are administered from the University Health Centre (UHC) at 20 Lower Kent Ridge Road. Tucked away on the second floor of the building after walking up a discreet stairwell is a lounge and a corridor of many closed-doored counselling rooms, the compounds of NUS's UCS. At the ground floor of the UHC is the clinic, consisting of over 10 doctors, all of which are employees of NUS, serving the large student population. At the basement is the Clinical and Health Psychology Centre (CHPC) run by the NUS Department of Psychology[^I11] that provides professional psychology help and assessment before allowing psychiatric intervention. There are approximately 2 or 3 psychiatrists at any one point of which one is Dr Clarice Hong Pei Hsia as of academic year 2018/19 term 1, according to ground research. Yale-NUS has its own Wellness Centre that is in some way affiliated to UCS. Also at the basement of UHC is the aptly named Wellness Office administering the system.

{title="Figure 7: UCS"}
![Figure 7: UCS's governance structure](images/7.UCS.jpg)

UCS is held within the purview of the NUS adminstration, specifically under Professor Florence Ling Yean Yng's, Vice Provost (Student Life) and faculty member of NUS Department of Building, School of Design and Environment (SDE), portfolio. Directly managing UHC is the director of UHC and medicl doctor, Dr Patrick Tan. Counselling services at Yale-NUS is headed up by Mr Goh Zhengqin, of which there is a team of around 10 counsellors. CHPC's acting director, as of the writing of this publication is Associate Professor Iliana Magiati.

All the three centres and the Wellness Centre of Yale-NUS cross-refer to each other to some extent and to the psychiatric services provided by the in-house psychiatrists. As stated on their website:

>
> *"Psychiatric consultations are only made through referrals from a counselor at UCS or a medical doctor at the University Health Service (Clinic)."*
> - *NUS website*
>

Should it be deemed necessary, students may be involuntarily pressured into NUH psychiatric Ward 33. NUH, National University Hospital, is the affiliated hospital to NUS's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (YLLSoM). It is recorded that some NUS students have been forced into the ward against their will after hitting the keywords "sad" or "depressed", but it is unknown to what extent this has been abused by counsellors in order to get students off their hands. It is also unknown whether UHC has an advisory board, much like what is set up in SMU and NTU.

It is also reported that it is part of the school policy and the purview of the Dean of Student Life of each faculty to interview and then refer students to UCS in the event of a drastic drop in GPA or failure on the pretext of "concerned(sic) for... well-being".

## NTU: University Wellbeing Centre

Located on the Jurong West region of Singapore, NTU was originally a Chinese University called Nanyang University. After a complicated merger and demerger with NUS, it was named NTU in 1991 and grew into a full fledged university, albeit with a strong focus on engineering. It also has its own Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCSoM) added in 2017.

{title="Figure 8: UWC"}
![Figure 8: UWC](images/8.UWC.jpg)

UWC is located within the University Health Services (UHS) building at 36 Nanyang Avenue on the second floor of the right and left wings - the right leading to the student counselling centre and the left leading to the student counselling centre. NTU is the only school that offers staff counselling. On the ground floor is the medical clinic that is in-sourced to private clinic operator Fullerton Healthcare, that is the operations are outsource but the clinic functions as though it is part of the school with students having to pay no medical fees, except for dental. Up the stairwell leading to UWC are various encouraging messages, after which you will be brought into a glass sliding door emblazoned with the words "University Wellbeing Centre (For Students)". The counselling rooms are hidden inside the building and well guarded by counter staff.

{title="Figure 9: UWC"}
![Figure 9: UWC's governance structure](images/9.UWC.jpg)

Affairs related to UHS is under Associate Provost (Student Life) Professor Anthony Kwok Kian-Woon, another prominent sociologist. The UHS itself is managed by medical doctor Dr Goh Chin Foo, with the title of Chief Health, Safety & Emergency Officer; And UWC, by Mariam Hamid, the head counsellor.

Similar to SMU, Prof Chong is the advisor to UHS holding the title of "Health Specialist Panel" along with Prof Kwok. This is no coincidence. Prof Kwok and Prof Chong have worked together on multiple pro-psychiatry research papers including the latest Singapore Mental Health Study 2016 funded through a grant from the Temasek Holdings financed Singapore Millennium Foundation Research Grant Programme.

## Outside of schools into our social services

Perhaps a common thread you might be getting is that it is unusual that sociology and psychiatry is consorting in such a manner.

Sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858-1917), widely viewed as the father of sociology and the emperical approach it employs, published Le suicide: Étude de sociologie [Suicide: A Study in Sociology] in 1897 to tackle to subject of suicide, challenging the monopoly of psychology, and hence also psychiatry, over the topic. Since mental distress and suicide can either be defined as a problem of society or a problem of psychology, a natural rivalry exists between the two fields.

Where sociology has lost out to psychiatry in is the backing of a powerful industry backing. Sociology has gained general acceptance across many fields, spreading its efforts quite thin, where psychology has focused almost its entire efforts defining suicide as a mental issue and psychiatry as a medical one, with products to sell.

This reflects no less in the way that social services in Singapore, and the world, is conducted. In Singapore, social servies fall under the purview of the Ministry of Social and Family Services (MSF) through the umbrella body the National Council of Social Services (NCSS) that coordinates over 450 social service entities. The mark of psychiatry permaeates throughout the social service sector, as seen 

{title="Figure 10: UWC",id="fig10"}
![Figure 10: Psychiatry in Singapore's social services](images/10.SocialServices.jpg)

Prof Chong is the pre-eminent intellectual authority in the mental health system as the only psychiatrist sitting on mental health policy formulation committees on both on national and tertiary education levels. He shares this position with Prof Kwok, whom unsurprising, is more than eager to agree with the narrative that social services and mental health are inextricably linked. Prof Chong is also chief examiner for the psychiatry residency programme and one of the examiners for the Singapore Association for Counselling.

[Figure 10](#fig10) also outlines the key institutions that uphold the mental health industry in Singapore. The premier instutition for mental health advocacy is SAMH, which has existed since 1968, and is mainly driven by the psychiatric community to drive the "mental health awareness" angle. The other organisation is the Silver Ribbon Commission, founded by three staff of IMH in 2005, and also the Singapore chapter of Ms Jean Singleton Liechty J.D.'s Silver Ribbon Coalition. The Silver Ribbon organisation takes the "destigmatisation" angle.

Another notable organisation is the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), a suicide hotline that grew into its current "suicide prevention" agenda, with some notable association with psychiatrists, though with a good mix of psychological and suicidological affiliations. It issues the media guidelines from which is based off WHO's recommendations.

Certainly, what we see is that the close relationship between academic psychiatry and academic sociology has translated into the practical nuts and bolts of applied psychiatry and social service policy. The implications to both national public policy and school policy has been tremendous. A systematic concealment of psychiatry is seen from head to toe by redirecting the public's attention to Wellness Porn messages, often justified under "not scaring" or preventing people from "seeking help".

Regardless of how many disorders there are, there stands only four main categories of drugs for which psychiatry deems can resolve all these purported disorders through the rebalancing of a "chemical imbalance", an unproven concept[^I13] that even if true, is not used in the clinical diagnosis as apparent in the DSM and in practice. The history of psychopharmacology, however, has never been to understand etiology before finding a pharmacological agent, but to work backwards; That is, most of the drugs were noted to have some form of psychoactive property when applied to other type of diseases, and then were imported into the field of psychiatry for these happenstance effects.
