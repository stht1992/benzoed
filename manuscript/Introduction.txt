# The Hook & Reel strategy:  A summary

![Figure 1: The Hook & Reel Strategy outlined](images/1.Hook&Reel.png)

Beneath the veneer of the "wellness" theme, counsellors and some psychologists are actually referral agents for the real business of abnormal psychology and "suicide prevention". It is not very obvious as these centres have put tremendous effort to shake off their traditional reputation of being associated with the stigma of "mental" issues. Over the years, the UCCs hve gone through major rebranding and outright masking of their true nature through various well disguised "mental health" campaigns and converted themselves into a form of self-motivational centres. An excellent case study is MWKLSWC, which has gone a step further and created networks of mental health advocates (i.e. SMU Peer Helpers) that tout support, encouragement and self-development. These centres promote "mental wellness" concepts such as "mindfulness" to normalise, and therefore destigmatise, the going for counselling services. Whether or not students actually need counselling, the UCCs have become a sort of free talk therapy service. All the universities, however, do mandate compulsory referral of struggling students to the UCCs, especially in the case of poor academic performance.

In reality, the field of psychology has been hijacked by pharmaceutical companies to prop up the mental health pharmaceutical supply chain. Research for psychology is readily financed by big pharmaceutical corporations as they are the referral agents to psychiatrists and doctors. For all three universities, this referral policy to psychiatrists and general practitioners is quite literally written in policy. Whether or not the doctor is out-sourced or internal differs between the big three autonomous universities in Singapore.

Abnormal psychology, or psychiatry, is a medical field that emerged from the mental asylum keepers of yore. It was with the discovery of anti-psychotic chlorpromazine in 1952, that sparked a medical revolution for the treatment of the insane. Finally, it seemed, there was hope for the mentally ill, and quickly, a series of new medical compounds were invented. 

These compounds can be broadly broken into four categories:  
1. Anti-psychotics: for the treatment of psychosis, such as schizophrenia and delusional disorders, the group that were traditionally referred to as the "insane".
2. Anti-depressants: for the treatment of depression, typically associated with suicide cases and the 
3. Anxiolytics or anti-anxiety agents: for the treatment of anxiety "disorders", such as panic disorder
4. Mood-
