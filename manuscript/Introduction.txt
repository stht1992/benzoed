## A summary

**Stage 1.** Beneath the veneer of the "wellness" theme, counsellors and some psychologists are actually referral agents for the real business of abnormal psychology and "suicide prevention". It is not very obvious as these centres have put tremendous effort to shake off their traditional reputation of being associated with the stigma of "mental" issues. Over the years, the UCCs hve gone through major rebranding and outright masking of their true nature through various well designed "mental health" campaigns and converted themselves into a form of self-motivational centres. An excellent case study is MWKLSWC, which has gone a step further and created networks of mental health advocates (i.e. SMU Peer Helpers) that tout support, encouragement and self-development. These centres promote "mental wellness" concepts such as "mindfulness" to normalise, and therefore destigmatise, the going for counselling services. Whether or not students actually need counselling, the UCCs have become a sort of free talk therapy service actively marketed to students. All the universities, however, do mandate compulsory referral of struggling students to the UCCs, especially in the case of poor academic performance.

**Stage 2.** In reality, the field of psychology has been hijacked by pharmaceutical companies to prop up the mental health pharmaceutical supply chain. Research for psychology is readily financed by deep-pocketed pharmaceutical corporations as they are the referral agents to psychiatrists and doctors. For all three universities, this referral policy to psychiatrists and general practitioners is quite literally written in policy. Whether or not the doctor is out-sourced or internal differs between the big three autonomous universities in Singapore.

**Stage 3.** Abnormal psychology, or psychiatry, is a medical field that emerged from the mental asylum keepers of yore. It was with the discovery of anti-psychotic chlorpromazine in 1952, that sparked a medical revolution for the treatment of the insane. Finally, it seemed, there was hope for the mentally ill, and quickly, a series of new medical compounds were invented. 

These compounds can be broadly broken into four categories:  
1. Anti-psychotics: for the treatment of psychosis, such as schizophrenia and delusional disorders, the group that were traditionally referred to as the "insane".

2. Anti-depressants: for the treatment of depression, typically associated with suicide cases and the lows of maniac bipolar disorder

3. Anxiolytics or anti-anxiety agents: for the treatment of anxiety "disorders", such as panic disorder

4. Mood-stabilisers: for the treatment of bipolar disorders, of which some of the notable agents are also anti-psychotics

The medicalisation of the care of the mentally ill in 1952 sparked a renaissance of sorts as the chaotic state of abnormal psychology and psychoanalyses prior to that period demanded a new form of taxonomic classification. It was that year that the American Psychiatric Association (APA), developed the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which has been the bible for the global mental health industry ever since. The unfortunate truth, that still holds till today, is that the DSM played and still plays no regard for the etiology of mental illnesses[^I1](#I1). Even to the present date, psychiatrists have produce no quantitative evidence before dishing out a diagnosis, unlike other medical professions. The perverse incentive for psychiatry, then, is to diagnose as much and as often as possible, with the unabashed support of the profiteering pharmaceutical industry. Psychiatric diagnoses have now become highly commercially influenced, with the number of diseases rising from 128 in DSM-I (1952) to 541 in DSM-V (2013). Correspondingly, the revenue of the APA Inc. has risen from US$1.27 million (1968) to US$135.23 million (2013)[^I2]^,^[^I3].

But worse, these drugs cause dependence and addiction. Once dependence sets in, the patient or victim, whether actually mentally ill or correctly diagnosed, experiences psychiatric drug withdrawal, which involves severe illness, both physical and mental. The psychiatric profession, unsurprisingly, has been mulish in the recognition, both in research and clinic setting, to recognise these effects. The result is an astounding cycle of iatrogenesis and **POLYDRUGGING**, sometimes under forced treatment, often resulting in **SUICIDE**.
