Contained within this publication is **graphic discussion about suicide, death and malpractice**. If you are emotionally vulnerable, you are **discouraged from proceeding further**.

Contained within this publication are graphic descriptions of the dangerous effects of psychiatric drugs. If you are currently taking any form of psychiatric medication, **do not stop taking your medication** without doctor’s advice or a proper taper regiment instated. Abrupt withdrawal from psychiatric medication, in particular, benzodiazepines, can lead to seizure, death and a severe withdrawal reaction that may result in brain damage and suicide. You are encouraged to refer to Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal by Peter Breggin, M.D. to find out how to withdraw safety from these drugs. You are encouraged to refer to the Ashton Manual by Professor Heather Ashton if your drug is a benzodiazepine. If you are suffering from psychosis or bipolar disorder, you are highly discouraged to discontinue medication as the drugs do work well for these conditions that involve the loss of mental capacity for example bipolar and schizophrenia.

## A call to action for those who suffer in silence

Pharmaceutical companies profit from our illness and they have the incentive to want us to be sick. This exposé and book aims to make aware to students that all **University Counselling Centres** (UCC) are linked to this global supply chain strategy to make us consume their drugs. Used appropriately as the last resort and for those who truly meet the criteria as disordered, these drugs can help people **relief emotional distress in the very short run**. Ultimately, their usage can wreck havoc on the patient’s life and may **trigger suicide** due to withdrawal.

Of the entire pharmacopoeia, there is one substance that may be the most damaging – benzodiazepines aka sleeping pills – due to its proliferation for off-label uses, high dependence-inducing qualities and poorly recognised withdrawal that may be unrivalled in pain, intensity and duration. Suicidal ideation and suicide may precipitate if proper tapering is not instituted.
We must all be aware! UCC counsellors do make doctor referrals but will not tell you anything about pharmacology. As such, you may not be equipped with the necessary information to understand the true risk benefit profile. Ignorance as to the qualities of the drug may expose you to psychiatric drug withdrawal that resembles underlying disorders. 

This includes:
* National University of Singapore (NUS)
: The University Counselling Services (UCS) located at the University Health Centre (UHC) building, second floor, and the Clinical and Health Psychology Centre (CHPC), located at the UHC building, basement, and Yale_NUS's Wellness Centre
* Nanyang Technological University (NTU)
: The University Wellbeing Centre (UWC) located at the University Health Service (UHS) building, second level, adjacent to the medical clinic
* Singapore Management University (SMU)
: Mrs Wong Kwok Leong Student Wellness Centre (MWKLSWC), located at the basement of Li Ka Shing Library at the foot of the steps of the T-Junction

Lives are being lost and harmed by this particular drug and others due to ignorance of its judicious usage. As users, we do not know, and sometimes, doctors are not adequately equipped, wilfully suppress or fail to imbue you with that information. These drugs are highly risky and potentially deadly. Information asymmetry exists in a hotbed of potential lemons.

On the outset, the news and medical reports read off as individuals that die because of their poor academic performance, stress, depression or “mental illness” after being shuffled into the UCC and discreetly referred to a psychiatrist. This may be true for some individuals but very unlikely for university students whom have gone through the rigors of the education system. In actual fact, they are being marketed poisonous pills for their “anxiety” and killing themselves due to the pain **on withdrawal**. It does not become apparent in post-mortem because (1) neuroimaging techniques as it stands cannot detect cellular damage, (2) psychiatrists & doctors can protect post-mortem or have already protected themselves at the point of prescription in the eyes of the law by labelling the individual as “disordered” with suicide being an act of volition to the courts and (3) the drug is no longer in the blood system.

Doctors and psychiatrists across the world are blind to this because they **only follow research studies and established treatment protocols**, which have been heavily influenced by vested interests and pharmaceutical profit incentives, in order to not be liable for deviating from **standard of care**. Some professionals even willfully suppress this because it is a matter of profits and the survival of the profession. Non-medical mental health professionals refuse to warn you about this because it is not their area of expertise. All of this is **at your expense**.

**Everyone must know about this danger, you will be saving lives. Stress doesn’t kill, but the drugs for stress do!** It is of public health concern that we are all aware of deficiencies in this system because it will not change overnight for you.

## Clarifications & disclaimers: To avert unnecessary criticism and strawman arguments that will slow progress

The author has received numerous criticisms that unnecessarily avert proper discussion into the real problems at hand and will result in unnecessarily repetition:

**You are stopping or scaring people from getting help and fearmongering:** Nothing contained in this publication can stop the operations of UCCs or the mental health community from continuing their trade unless the relevant policy makers deem it to be so. Information ought to be out there if the services and products being provided by UCCs & relevant parties are potentially dangerous and risky. Otherwise, a market of lemons persists. If there are obvious problems, as troubleshooted by the author, it needs to be fixed.

**You are proliferating an anti-treatment view:** The author does not propose the elimination of psychiatric treatment as he has witnessed on many occasions the loss of volition, resulting in unwilling self-harm, when senses do return. This is the case in psychotic and bipolar disorders. However, the author invites healthy skepticism as to the proper functioning of this system and as to whether all “disorders” should be treated if volition is not an issue. As to the author’s case, it was a GP, and not a psychiatrist that poisoned him, as such he was completely clueless as to the nature of the drug.

**You will deny help to people who are contemplating suicide:** The author refers to the first point. In addition, he is of the view that suicide and euthanasia are acts of volition, so long mental capacity is retained. And that the state, the medical and social work profession ought not to intervene further if nothing can be done. He is of the opinion that the social work profession has failed to receive adequate support and as such has allowed psychology and psychiatry to monetise society’s emotions. Many anectodal cases actually show that suicides can be caused by the drugging for non-suicidal issues such as ADHD and anxiety.

**Your assertions are not based on facts since your sources are Youtube videos and anecdotal anonymous accounts:** The author has hyperlinked numerous academic sources, textbooks, statements from experts, legislation, policies and many other sources that you may independently assess for credibility. The author is entitled to imbue original thought and opinions to the analysis. The author is entitled to restate, recount and compile the various testimonials necessary to support his thesis. The author is also entitled to recount to the best of his memory the events that occurred and the exact wording of what was communicated may not be exactly precise. You are entitled to believe the Earth is flat as so you wish and that these events never precipitated. The author is entitled to protect his and other people’s identities in order to encourage more people to contribute to his narrative given that mental health issues are widely stigmatized and categorically discriminated against. It is this same stigmatization proliferated by the pharmaceutical companies and psychiatric profession that has allowed adverse reports to remain undiscovered and for this market of lemons to persist.

**I took the same substance, maybe even longer, and had no reaction:** There are plenty of studies that show that individual differences in constitution and statistical distributions are at play when it comes to drug reactions and invites the medical and scientific community to address the issue with curiosity rather than abject denial, especially when there has already been extensive research done. The author is absolutely confused as to why he is repeatedly being gaslighted by multiple medical professionals even after presenting them with their own medical textbooks. For those who are still taking these drugs, the reaction does not happen until after cessation.

**You must be an addict or disordered:** The author has receipts to show what was prescribed and cannot possibly have obtained more without prescription. Moreover, benzodiazepines create dependence and rarely induce cravings, a key factor in distinguishing dependence and addiction. The assertion that the author is “disordered” or an “addict” constitutes an ad hominem argument that is fallacious. The author thus points out that the psychiatric profession has this unique power to subvert legal legitimacy by employing ad hominem arguments that are legally acceptable. As such, it has a unique protection when faced with legal challenges. The author was eating medicines as far as he knew from the GP and everyone reassured him of their safety and efficacy apart from a single warning of “It can be addictive”, ending up in hospital after cessation, and quite averse to any kind of prolong exposure to benzodiazepines.

The objective is to outline, to elucidate, to educate and to warn. The author makes no attempt with this publication to deny anyone from engaging in the services of UCCs.
