If you are currently taking any form of psychiatric medication, **do not stop taking your medication** without doctorâ€™s advice or a proper taper regiment instated. Abrupt withdrawal from psychiatric medication, in particular, benzodiazepines, can lead to seizure, death and a severe withdrawal reaction that may result in brain damage and suicide. You are encouraged to refer to Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal by Peter Breggin, M.D. to find out how to withdraw safety from these drugs. You are encouraged to refer to the Ashton Manual by Professor Heather Ashton if your drug is a benzodiazepine.
